### About this Project

**Aim:**

This project aimed to analyze pizza sales data using SQL queries to derive insights such as total orders, revenue, popular pizza types, and sales distribution across various dimensions. The goal was to uncover patterns and trends in pizza sales, leading to actionable recommendations.

**Process:**

The analysis was divided into three stages: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced.

- In the **Basic** stage, I focused on retrieving fundamental metrics such as the total number of orders, total revenue, and identifying the highest-priced pizza, most common pizza size, and top 5 most ordered pizza types.
- The **Intermediate** stage involved more complex queries, including joining tables to find category-wise pizza distribution, analyzing orders by the hour, and grouping orders by date to calculate daily averages.
- Finally, in the **Advanced** stage, I performed more detailed analysis such as calculating the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue, analyzing cumulative revenue trends, and identifying the top 3 pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category.

**Key Findings:**

- **Total Orders:** Retrieved the total number of orders placed.
- **Total Revenue:** Calculated total revenue generated from pizza sales.
- **Highest-Priced Pizza:** Identified the highest-priced pizza on the menu.
- **Most Common Pizza Size:** Found that the most commonly ordered pizza size was medium.
- **Top 5 Pizza Types:** Listed the top 5 most ordered pizza types and their quantities.

**Intermediate Insights:**

- **Pizza Category Quantities:** Joined tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.
- **Order Distribution by Hour:** Analyzed the distribution of orders by hour of the day, with peak orders occurring during dinner hours.
- **Category-Wise Distribution:** Found the distribution of pizzas based on category.
- **Average Pizzas Per Day:** Grouped orders by date and calculated the average number of pizzas ordered per day.
- **Top 3 Pizzas by Revenue:** Identified the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.

**Advanced Insights:**

- **Revenue Contribution:** Calculated the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.
- **Cumulative Revenue:** Analyzed the cumulative revenue generated over time.
- **Top 3 Pizzas by Category:** Determined the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each category.

**Summary:**

This SQL-based pizza sales analysis uncovered insights into order trends, revenue generation, and pizza preferences. By identifying top-selling pizza types, most common sizes, and distribution of sales across hours and categories, the analysis highlights opportunities for optimizing menu offerings, promotional strategies, and operations to maximize revenue.
